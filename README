This is the README file for the Call Commander package.

This software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  See the file 
COPYING for details.

This is the Call Commander Call Screener System, a Qt-based program for
managing live radio talk programs.  It currently supports the following
broadcast telephone systems:

    Comrex/Gentner TS-612
    Telos 100 1A2 Key Interface Module
    Telos 100 Direct Interface Module
    Telos ONEx6 System
    Telos 2101 Multistudio Telephone System
    Telos Nx12 Digital Telephone System
    Telos TWOx12 Digital Telephone System

Call Commander was designed to be easily extensible to additional types of
telephone systems.  If you don't see your hardware on this list, e-mail
me!

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The v1.5.x and v2.x series of CallCommander versions are *not*
backward compatible with the previous 1.3.x and 1.1.x versions.  When
upgrading, all server and client components should be upgraded
simultaneously.

A full set of documentation exists in the form of man pages.  Type
'man callcommander' at a shell prompt after installation to get started.

You will probably want to create a configuration file.  Call Commander
supports several options with regard to file location, see the ml(1)
man page for details.  To create a configuration, start by copying the
file 'samples/default.conf' in the source directory to the proper
location and then modify it as necessary.  The full format is
documented in the ml.conf(5) man page.

Good Luck!
