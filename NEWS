The NEWS file for the Call Commander package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1.1 -- 04/26/2013

Changes in this version include:

      Message Box Right-Click Menu.  Added a 'Clear' item to the menu
      that clears the contents of the Message Box (both local and
      remote).

      Graphical Cleanups.  Fixed multiple issues with rendering buttons
      and other graphical elements under various environments (OS X,
      GNOME).

      Various bugfixes.  The the ChangeLog for specifics.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1.0 -- 04/15/2013

Changes in this version include:

      Modified password storage in the database to use cleartext entries.
      Be sure to clear the password on at least one account with
      Admin rights before applying the update, then use this account
      to reset all passwords after the update.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.6 -- 08/24/2012

Changes in this version include:

      System-Wide Connection Manager Entries (Windows only).  It is now
      possible to configure CallCommander to store and retrieve Connection
      Manager entries to/from a common system-wide directory, rather than
      on a per-user basis by changing the value of the registry key
      \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SalemRadioLabs\CallCommander\
      ConnectionManagerScope from 'User' to 'System'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1 -- 08/18/2011

Changes in this version include:

      Qt port from 3.x to 4.x.

      Mac OS X Port.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5.31 -- 09/08/2009

Changes in this version include:

      Delay Button Display Options.  It is now possible to configure the delay
      button in ml(1) to display the current delay offset value by use of the
      'ShowDelay=' option in the [DelayButton] section of ml.conf(5).  The
      delay button can now be made to flash when the delay offset falls below
      the value set in 'DelayThreshold='.

      Message Box Changes.  It is now possible to paste large text messages
      through the message box without having the message split into smaller
      sections.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5.18 -- 05/28/2008

Changes in this version include:

      Asterisk PBX Support (EXPERIMENTAL).  It is now possible to use a
      suitably configured Asterisk system as a broadcast telephone interface,
      with CallCommander as the control interface.  Further information can be
      found in the 'ASTERISK.txt' file.

      Ml.conf(5) configuration directives.  A new 'SendTimeOffset=' parameter
      has been added to ml.conf(5) to allow cusotmization of the relaying of
      time offsets between ml(1) instances.  See the ml.conf(5) man page for
      details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5.3 -- 05/30/2006

This is the fourth beta release of the "new" CallCommander.
Additional changes over the previous v1.5.2 release include:

      Online Users List.  A new button, titled 'Who's Here?', has been
      added to the default CallCommander desktop that brings up a
      modeless dialog showing information regarding all users
      currently connected.  This button can be configured for custom
      layouts like any other control -- see the [ClientButton] section
      of the ml.conf(5) man page for details.

      CallerID Monitoring Tweaks.  The operation of mcidmd(8) has been
      modified so that connections to the host phone system are made
      only when a given show is active, so as to avoid exhausting the
      pool of available connections for certain phone systems
      (e.g. the Telos TWOx12).

      Caller Metadata Refreshing.  Late-joining ml(1) clients are now
      automatically refreshed to receive any caller data already
      entered from other clients.

      Various Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The v1.5.x series of CallCommander versions are *not*
backward compatible with the previous 1.3.x and 1.1.x versions.  When
upgrading from a 1.3.x or 1.1.x version, all server and client
components should be upgraded simultaneously.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.97.0,
   librhpi-0.94.6 and libtelos2101-1.2.0 be installed.  If installing
   from RPM, the version of the currently installed libraries can be 
   determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q libtelos2101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5.2 --05/19/2006

This is the third beta release of the "new" CallCommander.
Additional changes over the previous v1.5.1 release include:

      Ease Of Use Improvements.  The Connection Manager has been
      tweaked to make building connections to certain phone system
      types (e.g. Telos TWOx12) easier and more intuitive.

      Robustness Tweaks.  The two server components [mld(8) and
      mcidmd(8)] have been overhauled with a view to making their
      operation reliable even in the face of intermittent/rebooted
      phone system hardware.

      Miscellaneous Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The v1.5.x series of CallCommander versions are *not*
backward compatible with the previous 1.3.x and 1.1.x versions.  When
upgrading from a 1.3.x or 1.1.x version, all server and client
components should be upgraded simultaneously.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.97.0,
   librhpi-0.94.6 and libtelos2101-1.1.0 be installed.  If installing
   from RPM, the version of the currently installed libraries can be 
   determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q libtelos2101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5.1 --05/12/2006

This is the second beta release of the "new" CallCommander.
Additional changes over the previous v1.5.0 release include:

      New System Support.  Support for the following phone hardware
      has been added:
         Comrex/Gentner TS-612
         Telos 100 1A2 Key Interface Module
         Telos 100 Direct Interface Module
         Telos ONEx6 System

      Virtual System Support.  The above systems all use serial
      interfaces for computer control, inherently limiting them to control
      from a single system.  This release introduces the concept of a
      "virtual system", by which one or more serial-based phone system(s)
      can be virtualized so as to allow control from multiple points
      via TCP/IP networks using the "CallCommander Virtual Phone
      System".  These virtual systems are configured in the MDbAdmin tool.

      Many Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The v1.5.x series of CallCommander versions are *not*
backward compatible with the previous 1.3.x and 1.1.x versions.  When
upgrading, all server and client components should be upgraded
simultaneously.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.97.0,
   librhpi-0.94.6 and libtelos2101-1.1.0 be installed.  If installing
   from RPM, the version of the currently installed libraries can be 
   determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q libtelos2101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5.0 --05/05/2006

This is a preview release of the "new" CallCommander.  Major portions of
the code have been rewritten with an eye to stability and long-term 
maintainability.  Some of the highlights include:

      Native Telos 2101 Support.  Communication with the Telos 2101
      and TWOx12 phone systems now use the fully native 2101 control
      protocol.  No forwarding of control through the mld(8) daemon is
      necessary.

      Connection Manager.  A handy connection manager is now included
      in ml(1) that can be used to build connections on the fly.

      CallerID Logging.  Logging of CallerID data can now be done by
      means of the mcidmd(8) daemon.  This component acts as just
      another screener client, passively catching and logging CallerID
      data.  It can also be configured (via mdbadmin(1)) to get
      CallerID data from one or more attached WhozzCalling CallerID
      modem units.

      Configuration Changes.  Configuration for mcidmd(8), mdbadmin(1)
      and mcallman(1), with the exception of the [mySQL] section, has
      been moved out of mld.conf(5) and is now done in mdbadmin(1) by
      means of a point and click interface.  Versions of the
      ml.conf(5) configuration prepared for previous versions of
      CallCommander should continue to work properly with the
      exception of entries in the [Global] section, which have changed
      so as to work with the new Connection Manager interface.  See
      the ml.conf(5) man page for details.

As of this version, ONLY the Telos 2101 and TWOx12 systems are
supported.  Support for the other systems (Telos 100 family and
Gentner TS-612) will be added back in as the codebase matures.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.97.0,
   librhpi-0.94.6 and libtelos2101-1.1.0 be installed.  If installing
   from RPM, the version of the currently installed libraries can be 
   determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q libtelos2101

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.3.25 --02/15/2006

This is a bugfix release of CallCommander.  See the ChangeLog for
details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.3.24 --01/26/2006

This is a bugfix release of CallCommander.  See the ChangeLog for
details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.3.23 --01/03/2006

Changes:
      Added a 'CallerId<n>Line=' directive to mld.conf(5) that allows
      use of the WhozzCalling CallerID modem in situations where the
      line number scheme used by the WhozzCalling unit doesn't match
      that of the underlying phone system.  See the mld.conf(5) man
      page for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.3.17 -- 8/15/2005

Changes:
      Kill Device Changes.  Kill devices are now configured on a
      show-by-show basis, rather then globally across a complete group
      in mld(8).  See the mld(5) man page for changes in the
      configuration syntax to reflect this.

      Ml(1) configuration file on Windows.  The configuration file for
      ml(1) on Windows has been moved.  By default, it is
      [Program-dir]/ml.ini, where [Program-dir] is the installation
      directory of the program (normally, 'C:\Program
      Files\CallCommander\'.

      Bugfixes.  A bunch.  See the ChangeLog for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1.12 -- 4/27/2004
Private Beta release.

      Major work on Telos Direct Interface Module support.  Full
      hand-free control of Mitel Superset IV screener phones is now
      possible by connecting in Producer Mode to VD1 or VD2 (for
      screener phone #1 or #2 respectively).

      There is no longer a single 'Telos100' protocol for use in the
      'Protocol=' directive of mld.conf(5), but rather seperate
      protocols for the various Telos models.  See the mld.conf(5) man
      page for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1.10 -- 3/29/2004
Private Beta release.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1.6 -- 8/22/2003
Private Beta release.  The major highlights:

      On Win32, the network virtualization daemon (mld) is now more integrated 
      into the Windows environment.  Instead of getting it's configuration
      from a file, it now reads it from the Registry.  A new program,
      'mldconf', is used to configure those entries and will start/stop/
      resync 'mld' as needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1.5 -- 8/17/2003
Private Beta release.  The major highlights:

      Win32 support.  The build system uses qmake(1) rather than the
      GNU Autotools.  Both ml(1) and mld(8) have been ported.

      It's now possible to specify the configuration file for mld(8)
      to use by passing it as the last argument on the command line.

      Various bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1.2 -- 6/20/2003
Public Beta release.  The major highlights:

      It's now possible to assign hotkeys to bring up the Call
      Information dialog box for each line.  See the ml(1) and 
      ml.conf(5) man pages for details.

      Font rendering fixes.  This corrects problems seen in certain
      distros (notably SuSE 8.2) where the screen fonts display
      abnormally large characters.

      RPM build support is now integrated into Call Commander's build
      system.  After building the basic system, just do (as root):

	       make rpm

      Miscellaneous minor bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1.1 -- 4/17/2003
Beta release.  The major highlights:

      Comrex/Gentner TS-612 support.  Works very similarly to Telos100
      systems (using mld(8)).  The firmware version installed in the
      TS-612 is critical for getting things to work right -- you need
      at least v3.0.

      Call Skimmer (mcs).  This is an audio recorder that can be
      configured to automatically record calls.  It works with both
      ALSA and AudioScience sound cards.  See the mcs(1) manpage for
      details.

      mySQL Database Logging.  In addition to the hard drive, it's now
      possible to log calls to a table in a mySQL database.  See the
      [Logging] section in the ml.conf(5) manpage for details.

      And, the usual miscellaneous bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1 -- 12/09/2002

      Fixed a bug that was causing the Segment Clock to output
      incorrect countdown times when used with non-zero offset times.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.0 -- 12/09/2002
The initial Production Release.

     The name of the package has been changed from 'Mithlond' to
     'Call Commander'.

     Several bugs that affect Call Commander have been fixed in 
     'libradio' since the last release.  Be sure you have at least
     v0.12.3 before building!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.5.1 -- 11/10/2002
Release Cadndidate Two

     Fixed the login box in 'ml' so that the 'S' in 'Studio Group' is
     not clipped.

     Changed the default color of the DUMP button 'ml' from gray to
     red.

     Several bugs that affect Mithlond have been fixed in 'libradio'
     since the last release.  Be sure you have at least v0.12.1 before
     building!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.5.0 -- 11/06/2002
Release Candidate One

     Upgraded the source code to compile properly with gcc 3.2.

     Added two new sample configurations:
        swcons.conf -- Provides the look of a "classic" Telos 100
                       switch console
        dks-screen.conf -- Layout used by the Don Kroah Show in
                           Washington DC.

     Several bugs that affect Mithlond have been fixed in 'libradio'
     since the last release.  Be sure you have at least v0.12.0 before
     building!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.0 -- 10/16/2002
The fourth beta release.

     Numerous stability and bug fixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

     Added a "Caller Quality" rating flag.  It's now possible to rate
     each call as being Very Poor, Poor, Fair, Good or Excellent.
     Each rating puts a characteristic icon into that call's Caller
     Info box.  A macro has also been added to allow this rating to be
     logged.

     Added a "Look Up!" feature.  Touching the receive portion of the
     Message Box widget will turn the widget red with the admonition
     to "Look Up!" printed upon it in large letters.  After a few
     seconds (configurable in ml.conf(5)), things go back to normal.

     Overhauled the layout data format in the [CallerBox] section of
     ml.conf(5).  In addition to specifying position, it's now possible
     to specify the size of each element as well.  This makes it
     possible for ml(1) to intelligently word-wrap the elements if
     they become longer than a single line can hold.  (NOTE: if you've
     created a custom caller box layout in a previous version, you'll 
     likely need to tweak it some to make it work.  Default cases
     should continue to work fine.

     Implemented several internal optimizations to ml(1) to make it
     run more efficiently and with less screen flicker.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.3.1 -- 9/19/2002

    Added a custom caller dialog box for Telos 100 systems that allow the
    screener to place calls into Screened Hold.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.3.0 -- 9/18/2002
The third beta release.  More new goodies, including:

    Numerous stability and bug fixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

    Several "eye-candy" enhancements (check out that record button, 
    Gertrude...)

    Customizable Caller Box layout.  You can now define exactly what
    information should appear there, where and with what font and size.

    Settable Caller Box size.

    Removed the STREET caller attribute.

    Added an AGE caller attribute.

    Added a CELLPHONE caller attribute.

    Completely overhauled the Caller Data dialog in light of feedback
    received from the field.  Layout, presentation and tab order of
    the fields have all been changed.

    Added Hotkey support.  Every button can now be assigned a shortcut
    key (settable in the configuration file).

    Added the 'mld' daemon, thus providing support for the Telos 100 line 
    of telephone systems, including:
        Telos 100 1A2 Key Interface Module
        Telos 100 Direct Interface Module
        Telos ONEx6 Broadcast Telephone Interface

    Added password authentication support.  Doesn't work with the TWOx12
    (due to non-implementation of their own protocol on Telos' part), but
    works nicely with 'mld'.

    Added the ability to specify the Studio Group in 'ml'.  Needed to support
    multiple phone systems in 'mld'.

    Complete documentation in the form of man pages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.0 -- 9/3/2002
The first beta release.  Lots of new goodies, including:
    Geometry can be set in the [Global] section using:
	     WindowX=
	     WindowY=
	     SizeX=
	     SizeY=

    Ring Timers for calls ringing in

    The displayed time can be offset through use of the TimeOffset=
    parameter in [Clock].  Units are +/- seconds.

    Each line button can now be assigned a custom label and font size
    using the Label= and FontSize= parameters in the [LineN] sections.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.1 -- 9/1/2002
The initial (and hopefully only) ALPHA release.  Feature-complete, but 
virtually no documentation to speak of.  As for bugs, who knows??
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
