CallCommander contains experimental support for controlling the 
Asterisk Open Source PBX by means of the Asterisk Management Interface.
Source code and documentation for Asterisk are available at
http://www.asterisk.org/.

To configure Asterisk to work with CallCommander, you need to:

1) Create the '/etc/asterisk/callcommander.conf' file.  A sample 
can be found in 'asterisk/callcommander.conf-sample' in the 
CallCommander source tree.  This file defines which Asterisk channels, 
contexts and extensions will be used for the various CallCommander
devices (hybrids and screener stations).  At present, only a single 
channel device, the OSS Console, is fully supported.

2) Create dialplan rules in '/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf' in
accordance with the resources defined in 'callcommander.conf'.  A 
sample can be found in 'asterisk/extensions.conf-sample'.

3) Ensure that an area is defined for parking calls in
'/etc/asterisk/features.conf' (needed in order for call holding to work
correctly).  A sample is in 'asterisk/features.conf-sample'.

4) Ensure that incoming trunks are configured to use the correct 
initial context.  A sample 'asterisk/zaptel.conf-sample' file is 
provided as an example of how to do this for Zaptel cards.

5) Configure an Asterisk Manager Interface connection profile in
'/etc/asterisk/manager.conf'.  An example is in
'asterisk/manager.conf-sample'.
 
6) Restart Asterisk

7) You should now be able to connect using the 'Asterisk Open Source PBX'
connection type with the appropriate parameters in CallCommander's
Connection Manager.
